BILLION DOLLAR PRIVATE COMPANIES (A MARKET INTELLIGENCE PROJECT)

INTRODUCTION

This project looks at the fascinating world of unicorns i.e. privately held companies that have achieved a valuation of 1 billion dollars and above. We get to look at growth trends across different industries, time spans and geographical hubs. In addition to this, we find out which companies are the top performing privately held startups.

DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING

The data used in this project was sourced from KAGGLE. Pre-processing of the data was performed on excel which included cleaning and transformation. In addition to this, a new column was created using Power BI that would allocate the appropriate continent to each country in our dataset. This was done to allow for analysis of data across different continents. Finally, an interactive dashboard was created on Power BI that presented key metrics and insights.
